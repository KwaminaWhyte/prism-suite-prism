# The Prism Suite — an open source creative suite

Pigment is app #1 of a planned **four-app suite** that works together the way
Adobe's Creative Cloud apps do (Dynamic Link, smart objects, shared color and
assets). The shared engine crates Pigment is built on (`pigment-core`,
`pigment-gpu` compositor, color management, render graph) are designed from the
start to be reused across all four.

> Names below are provisional. The umbrella is **Prism** (light → pigments).

## The four apps

| # | App | Adobe analog | Domain | Open source we build on / fork from |
|---|-----|--------------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Pigment** | Photoshop | Raster image editing | greenfield (Rust/wgpu); ideas from Krita/mypaint |
| 2 | **Contour** | Illustrator | Vector graphics | `kurbo` + `lyon` + `i_overlay`; ideas from Inkscape |
| 3 | **Reel** | Premiere Pro | Video editing (NLE) | FFmpeg, MLT-style engine; ideas from Kdenlive |
| 4 | **Pulse** | After Effects | Motion graphics / VFX / compositing | OpenFX, OpenColorIO, OpenEXR; ideas from Natron |

## Why a suite, not four apps

Adobe's real moat isn't any single app — it's that they **interoperate**: a
shape pasted from Illustrator stays editable, an After Effects comp drops into a
Premiere timeline via Dynamic Link and updates live, everything shares the same
color. We get this for free *if* the shared layer/compositor/color engine is one
codebase. That is the whole architectural bet.

## Shared foundation (one engine, four apps)

```
                ┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐
   Pigment ─┐   │  prism-core    layer/scene graph, tiles,   │
   Contour ─┤   │                command/undo, doc model     │
   Reel    ─┼──▶│  prism-gpu     wgpu render graph,           │
   Pulse   ─┘   │                blend/effect passes, tiles   │
                │  prism-color   linear-light, ICC/OCIO, CMYK │
                │  prism-media   FFmpeg decode/encode, audio  │
                │  prism-fx      OpenFX-style effect plugins   │
                │  prism-io      file formats + interchange    │
                └───────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Today these live as `pigment-core` / `pigment-gpu` / etc. When app #2 starts,
the reusable parts get promoted to `prism-*` crates and Pigment depends on them.
The render graph, tile model, blend math, and color pipeline are **identical**
needs for raster, vector raster preview, video frames, and comp layers.

## Interop mechanisms (the Adobe-parity features)

1. **Dynamic Link** — a Pulse comp referenced in a Reel timeline renders live;
   editing the comp updates the edit. Same for a Contour artboard placed in
   Pigment. Implemented as a shared render-graph node that evaluates the linked
   document on demand (cached per frame/tile).
2. **Smart objects / live placement** — place a `.contour` vector doc or a
   `.pigment` doc inside another app; it stays editable at its source resolution,
   re-rasterized on transform.
3. **Common interchange format** — a `prism-doc` container (layer tree + scene
   graph + media refs) that every app reads. Lossy-but-faithful import/export to
   PSD/AI/SVG/Premiere XML/AEP-ish as bridges to Adobe.
4. **Shared clipboard** — copy a path, layer, keyframe, or color in one app,
   paste editable in another (shared in-memory model + serialized fallback).
5. **One color pipeline** — `prism-color` (linear-light, ICC + OpenColorIO)
   means a color/look is identical across all four apps and on export.
6. **Shared effects** — `prism-fx` (OpenFX-style) effects run in any app that
   composites: blurs, grades, distortions authored once.
7. **Shared asset library** — brushes, gradients, LUTs, fonts, templates in a
   common store all apps see.

## Suite roadmap (high level)

**Status (June 2026):** all four apps are scaffolded and run; the shared crates
(`prism-core` / `prism-color` / `prism-io`) are **already promoted** to `prism/crates/`
and consumed by every app. Each app now has a parity roadmap to **≥85% of its Adobe
analog** — see its `PLAN.md` (and [RESEARCH.md](./RESEARCH.md) for the suite-level
shared-engine + interop research).

| App | Analog | Built today | ~Parity | Plan |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Pigment** | Photoshop | GPU compositor, layers/blend, brush, selection/transform, adjustments/masks/filters, text/vector basics, PSD/EXR IO | ~60% | [pigment/PLAN.md](./pigment/PLAN.md) |
| **Contour** | Illustrator | Bézier pen, shapes, pathfinder, SVG/PNG export, save | ~25% | [contour/PLAN.md](./contour/PLAN.md) |
| **Reel** | Premiere Pro | Multitrack timeline, clip move/trim, stills preview, bin, save | ~8% | [reel/PLAN.md](./reel/PLAN.md) |
| **Pulse** | After Effects | Comp + keyframe timeline, animated solid preview, save | ~10% | [pulse/PLAN.md](./pulse/PLAN.md) |

**Next levers (foundation-first — build what gates breadth, then fan out):**

- **Pigment:** retouch/heal core + layer styles / smart objects (the biggest felt-parity jumps).
- **Contour:** undo, then selection / layers / appearance & gradients.
- **Pulse:** the foundation rebuild — typed `Property<T>` + Bézier easing + GPU compositor — before breadth.
- **Reel:** the A/V engine — FFmpeg video decode + audio + source in/out — without it, it isn't an editor.

**Shared-crate promotions still ahead** (coordinate across app owners before promoting; keep app-agnostic):
`prism-vector` (paths/booleans/stroke — Contour + Pigment shape layers + Pulse masks), `prism-fx`
(OpenFX-style effects/transitions — all four), `prism-media` (FFmpeg + audio — Pulse + Reel),
`prism-ai` (`ort` runtime + on-demand models — all four), `prism-doc` (interchange + Dynamic-Link node).

Each app is independently useful; the value compounds as interop lands.

*Foundations are free. The product is the polish — and the glue between apps.*
